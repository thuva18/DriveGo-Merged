## 🏗️ Architecture

### File Structure
```
src/
├── main/
│   ├── java/
│   │   └── com/drivego/vehicle/
│   │       ├── Vehicle.java (Entity with image & imageUrl fields)
│   │       └── VehicleController.java (Handles file uploads)
│   ├── resources/
│   │   ├── static/
│   │   │   └── uploads/
│   │   │       └── vehicles/  ← Uploaded images stored here
│   │   └── application.yml (Multipart config)
│   └── webapp/
│       └── WEB-INF/
│           └── jsp/
│               └── vehicles/
│                   ├── form.jsp (Upload form)
│                   └── list.jsp (Display images)
```

### Image Priority
1. **First Priority:** `image` field (uploaded file)
2. **Second Priority:** `imageUrl` field (external URL)
3. **Fallback:** Car icon placeholder

## 🔧 Configuration

### application.yml
```yaml
spring:
  servlet:
    multipart:
      enabled: true
      max-file-size: 10MB
      max-request-size: 10MB
      file-size-threshold: 2KB
```

### Vehicle Entity (Vehicle.java)
```java
private String imageUrl;  // External image URL
private String image;     // Uploaded image filename
```

### VehicleController Enhancements
- **File Upload Handling:** `saveImage(MultipartFile file)`
- **Unique Filename Generation:** UUID-based naming
- **Directory Management:** Auto-creates upload directory
- **Error Handling:** IOException handling for upload failures

## 📝 How to Use

### Adding New Vehicle with Image

1. Navigate to `/vehicles/new`
2. Fill in vehicle details
3. Choose ONE of these options:
   - **Option A:** Enter image URL in "Vehicle Image URL" field
   - **Option B:** Click "Choose File" and select an image from your computer
4. See live preview of selected image
5. Click "Add Vehicle"

### Editing Vehicle Image

1. Navigate to `/vehicles`
2. Click "Edit" on any vehicle
3. To change image:
   - **Option A:** Update the URL in "Vehicle Image URL"
   - **Option B:** Upload a new image (replaces old one)
4. Click "Update Vehicle"

### Image Display Logic

**In Vehicle List (`list.jsp`):**
```jsp
<c:choose>
    <c:when test="${not empty vehicle.image}">
        <!-- Shows uploaded image -->
        <img src="<c:url value='/uploads/vehicles/${vehicle.image}'/>" />
    </c:when>
    <c:when test="${not empty vehicle.imageUrl}">
        <!-- Shows URL-based image -->
        <img src="${vehicle.imageUrl}" />
    </c:when>
    <c:otherwise>
        <!-- Shows placeholder icon -->
        <i class="fas fa-car"></i>
    </c:otherwise>
</c:choose>
```

## 🎨 Features in Detail

### 1. Image Preview (Real-time)
- See image immediately after selecting file
- No need to save first
- JavaScript-based preview
- Displays current image when editing

### 2. Unique Filenames
```java
// Example: abc123e4-f567-890g-h123-456789ijklmn.jpg
String uniqueFilename = UUID.randomUUID().toString() + fileExtension;
```

### 3. File Storage
- Location: `src/main/resources/static/uploads/vehicles/`
- Auto-creates directory if doesn't exist
- Files accessible via URL: `/uploads/vehicles/{filename}`

### 4. Form Encoding
```jsp
<form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
```
**Important:** `enctype="multipart/form-data"` is required for file uploads!

### 5. Update Behavior
- If new image uploaded → replaces old image
- If no new image → keeps existing image
- Handles both new vehicles and updates

## 🚀 Testing the Feature

### Test 1: Upload New Image
```
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/vehicles/new
2. Fill in: regNo="TEST-001", model="Test Car", rentalPrice=50, fuelType="PETROL"

4. See preview appear
5. Click "Add Vehicle"
6. Verify image shows in vehicle list
```

### Test 2: Use External URL
```
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/vehicles/new
2. Fill in vehicle details
3. Enter URL: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1621007947382-bb3c3994e3fb?w=800
4. Leave file upload empty
5. Click "Add Vehicle"
6. Verify URL image shows in vehicle list
```

### Test 3: Update Existing Vehicle
```
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/vehicles
2. Click "Edit" on any vehicle

```

### Test 4: Priority Testing
```

2. Edit and upload file image
3. Result: Uploaded image takes priority
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Image Not Showing
**Possible Causes:**
1. File not uploaded correctly
2. Directory permissions
3. File path incorrect

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if file exists
ls src/main/resources/static/uploads/vehicles/

# Check file permissions
chmod 755 src/main/resources/static/uploads/vehicles/

# Verify in browser
http://localhost:8080/uploads/vehicles/{filename}
```

### Issue: "Failed to upload image"
**Possible Causes:**
1. File too large (>10MB)
2. Invalid file format
3. Directory doesn't exist
4. No write permissions

**Solution:**
```bash
# Create directory manually
mkdir -p src/main/resources/static/uploads/vehicles

# Set permissions
chmod 755 src/main/resources/static/uploads/vehicles
```

### Issue: Preview Not Working
**Possible Causes:**
1. JavaScript not loaded
2. Browser compatibility
3. File input not triggering event

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure file input has `onchange="previewImage(event)"`
- Try different browser

## 📊 Database Queries

### Check Uploaded Images
```sql
SELECT reg_no, model, image, image_url 
FROM vehicles 
WHERE image IS NOT NULL OR image_url IS NOT NULL;
```

### Count Images by Type
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN image IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as uploaded_images,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN image_url IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as url_images,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN image IS NULL AND image_url IS NULL THEN 1 END) as no_images
FROM vehicles;
```

### Find Vehicles Without Images
```sql
SELECT reg_no, model 
FROM vehicles 
WHERE image IS NULL AND image_url IS NULL;
```

### Update Multiple Vehicles with Sample Images
```sql
-- Add sample images to existing vehicles
UPDATE vehicles 
SET image_url = 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1621007947382-bb3c3994e3fb?w=800' 
WHERE image IS NULL AND image_url IS NULL 
LIMIT 5;
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Image Guidelines
1. **Dimensions:** Minimum 800x600px recommended
2. **Format:** JPG for photos, PNG for graphics
3. **File Size:** Keep under 2MB for faster loading
4. **Naming:** System handles naming automatically
5. **Orientation:** Landscape (horizontal) preferred

### Performance Tips
1. Use compressed images (tools: TinyPNG, ImageOptim)
2. Consider lazy loading for large lists
3. Implement image thumbnail generation (future enhancement)
4. Use CDN for production (future enhancement)

### Security Considerations
1. File type validation in place (accept="image/*")
2. File size limits configured (max 10MB)
3. Unique filenames prevent overwriting
4. Files stored outside web root for security

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. **Multiple Images per Vehicle**
   - Image gallery slider
   - Primary image selection
   - Delete individual images

2. **Image Processing**
   - Auto-resize on upload
   - Thumbnail generation
   - Image optimization
   - Watermarking

3. **Cloud Storage Integration**
   - AWS S3 storage
   - Azure Blob Storage
   - Google Cloud Storage

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Drag & drop upload
   - Bulk image upload
   - Image cropping tool
   - 360° vehicle views

5. **Image Management**
   - Delete unused images
   - Image version history
   - Batch operations
   - Image compression

## 📖 Code Examples

### Upload Image via Form
```html
<form method="POST" action="/vehicles/save" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="text" name="regNo" required />
    <input type="text" name="model" required />
    <input type="file" name="imageFile" accept="image/*" />
    <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```

### Display Image in JSP
```jsp
<c:choose>
    <c:when test="${not empty vehicle.image}">
        <img src="/uploads/vehicles/${vehicle.image}" alt="${vehicle.model}" />
    </c:when>
    <c:when test="${not empty vehicle.imageUrl}">
        <img src="${vehicle.imageUrl}" alt="${vehicle.model}" />
    </c:when>
    <c:otherwise>
        <i class="fas fa-car"></i>
    </c:otherwise>
</c:choose>
```

### Check Upload Directory
```bash
# View uploaded images
ls -lh src/main/resources/static/uploads/vehicles/

# Count images
find src/main/resources/static/uploads/vehicles/ -type f | wc -l

# Disk usage
du -sh src/main/resources/static/uploads/vehicles/
```
