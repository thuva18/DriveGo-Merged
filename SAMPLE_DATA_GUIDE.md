# 🚀 DriveGo - Automatic Database Setup with Sample Data

## ✨ What's Included

Your DriveGo application now **automatically creates ALL tables and loads sample data** when you run it!

### Sample Data Included:

| Data Type | Count | Details |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| 👤 **Users** | 4 | 1 Admin, 2 Regular Users, 1 Guest |
| 🔑 **Roles** | 2 | ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN |
| 🚗 **Vehicles** | 15 | Economy, Sedan, SUV, Luxury, Vans |
| 📅 **Bookings** | 7 | Confirmed, Pending, Completed, Cancelled |
| 💳 **Payments** | 6 | Completed, Pending, Failed |
| 🏦 **Payment Methods** | 6 | Card, Cash, Bank Transfer, PayPal |
| 📊 **Reports** | 3 | Revenue, Fleet Usage, Customer reports |
| 📄 **Receipts** | 1 | Sample bank transfer receipt |

## 🎯 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Create Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE DriveGo2;
```

### Step 2: Update Credentials (Optional)
If not using `root` user, update `src/main/resources/application.yml`:
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    username: your_username
    password: your_password
```

### Step 3: Run Application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**That's it!** 🎉

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### application.yml Settings

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/DriveGo2?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
    driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    username: root
    password: Ravindu@333
    
  sql:
    init:
      mode: always               # ← Runs data.sql on startup
      continue-on-error: true    # ← Ignores duplicate errors
      
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update           # ← Auto-creates/updates tables
```

### How It Works

1. **Hibernate DDL (`ddl-auto: update`)**:
   - Scans all `@Entity` classes
   - Creates tables if they don't exist
   - Updates existing tables if structure changed
   - **Preserves existing data** ✅

2. **SQL Init (`mode: always`)**:
   - Executes `src/main/resources/data.sql`
   - Runs on every startup
   - Uses `INSERT IGNORE` to skip duplicates
   - Safe to run multiple times ✅

## 🧪 Testing on Fresh Database

### Manual Test
```sql
-- 1. Create test database
CREATE DATABASE DriveGo2_Test;

-- 2. Update application.yml to use DriveGo2_Test

-- 3. Run application
mvn spring-boot:run

-- 4. Verify data
USE DriveGo2_Test;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles;    -- Should return 15
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM car_bookings; -- Should return 7
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments;     -- Should return 6
```

### Automated Test Script
```bash
./test-fresh-database.sh
```

This script will:
1. Create a fresh test database
2. Update configuration temporarily
3. Run the application
4. Restore original configuration

## 📊 Verify Sample Data

After starting the application, check your data:

```sql
USE DriveGo2;

-- Check tables created
SHOW TABLES;

-- Check sample data counts
SELECT 'Users' as Table_Name, COUNT(*) as Count FROM users
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Vehicles', COUNT(*) FROM vehicles
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Bookings', COUNT(*) FROM car_bookings
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Payments', COUNT(*) FROM payments
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Payment Methods', COUNT(*) FROM payment_methods
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Roles', COUNT(*) FROM roles;

-- View sample vehicles
SELECT reg_no, model, rental_price, availability 
FROM vehicles 
ORDER BY rental_price;

-- View sample bookings
SELECT id, contact_person_name, vehicle_reg_no, status, pickup_date 
FROM car_bookings 
ORDER BY booking_date DESC;

-- View sample payments
SELECT payment_id, booking_id, payment_method, amount, payment_status 
FROM payments 
ORDER BY payment_date DESC;
```

Expected Results:
```
Table_Name       | Count
-----------------|------
Users            | 4
Vehicles         | 15
Bookings         | 7
Payments         | 6
Payment Methods  | 6
Roles            | 2
```

## 🔄 Re-running on Existing Database

**Safe to re-run!** The application uses:
- `INSERT IGNORE` - Skips existing records
- `ddl-auto: update` - Doesn't delete data

If you want to **reset data**:
```sql
-- Option 1: Drop and recreate specific tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS payments;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS car_bookings;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS vehicles;
-- Then restart application

-- Option 2: Drop entire database
DROP DATABASE DriveGo2;
CREATE DATABASE DriveGo2;
-- Then restart application
```

## 🌍 Deploying to Another Device

### What to Do on New Device:

1. **Install Prerequisites**:
   - MySQL 8.0+
   - Java 17+
   - Maven 3.6+

2. **Create Database**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE DriveGo2;
   ```

3. **Update Credentials**:
   Edit `src/main/resources/application.yml`

4. **Run Application**:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Access Application**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

**Everything else happens automatically!** ✨

## 🔐 Production Recommendations

For production deployment:

### 1. Use Environment Variables
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: ${DB_URL:jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/DriveGo2}
    username: ${DB_USERNAME:root}
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
```

```bash
export DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://production-server:3306/DriveGo2
export DB_USERNAME=drivego_user
export DB_PASSWORD=SecurePassword123
```

### 2. Change DDL Mode
```yaml
spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate  # Don't auto-modify in production
```

### 3. Disable Sample Data
```yaml
spring:
  sql:
    init:
      mode: never  # Don't run data.sql in production
```

### 4. Use Real Passwords
The sample users have placeholder passwords. Update them:
- Through application's user management
- Or hash passwords using BCrypt and update database

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Duplicate entry" errors
**Normal!** `INSERT IGNORE` safely skips duplicates.

### Issue: Tables not created
**Check:**
- `ddl-auto: update` in application.yml
- MySQL user has CREATE privilege
- Application logs for errors

### Issue: Data not loaded
**Check:**
- `sql.init.mode: always` in application.yml
- `data.sql` file exists in `src/main/resources/`
- MySQL user has INSERT privilege

### Issue: Wrong data counts
**Reason:** Data already exists from previous runs.
**Solution:** Drop and recreate database for fresh start.

## 📝 Customizing Sample Data

To modify sample data, edit:
```
src/main/resources/data.sql
```

Then restart the application:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## 🎓 Summary
