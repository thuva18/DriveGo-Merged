## UI Theme
- **Primary Colors**: Black (#000000, #1a1a1a)

## Testing the System

### Test Scenario 1: View All Bookings
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/bookings`
2. Should see list of all bookings with pagination
3. Current data: 2 bookings in PENDING status

### Test Scenario 2: Update Booking Status
1. Click the edit dropdown on any booking
2. Select "Mark Confirmed"
3. Confirm the action
4. Should see success message and updated status

### Test Scenario 3: View Booking Details
1. Click the eye icon on any booking
2. Should navigate to detailed view
3. All information should be displayed
4. Action buttons appropriate to current status

### Test Scenario 4: Delete Booking
1. Click the trash icon on any booking
2. Confirm deletion
3. Should be removed from list
4. Database: `delete_status` = 1

### Test Scenario 5: Filter Bookings
1. Enter email in filter: `bob@drivego.com`
2. Click Search
3. Should show only matching bookings

## Current Database State
```sql
-- Two test bookings exist:
ID: 1 - Honda Civic (WP-CDE-003) - Oct 19-22, 2025 - PENDING
ID: 2 - Suzuki Swift (WP-BCD-002) - Oct 19-26, 2025 - PENDING
```

## Integration Points

### With Payment System:
- "Create Payment" button links to payment creation
- Pre-fills booking ID
- "View Payments" shows all payments for booking

### With Vehicle System:
- Vehicle Reg No displayed and linked
- Availability checking (future enhancement)

### With Customer Portal:
- Customers can view their bookings at `/customer/my-bookings`
- Real-time status updates reflected
- Booking creation flow validated

## Security Notes
⚠️ **Current Configuration**: 
- All endpoints use `permitAll()` for testing
- **Production**: Add proper role-based access:
  - Admin role required for `/bookings/**`
  - CSRF protection enabled (already in place)

## Future Enhancements
1. **Email Notifications**: Send email on status changes
2. **Booking Analytics**: Dashboard with stats
3. **Bulk Actions**: Multi-select bookings for batch operations
4. **Export**: CSV/PDF export of booking records
5. **Advanced Filters**: Date range, vehicle type, location
6. **Booking Calendar**: Visual calendar view
7. **Payment Integration**: Direct payment creation from booking
8. **Vehicle Availability**: Real-time availability checking

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend:
- `CarBookingController.java` - Added delete endpoint
- `CarBookingService.java` - Updated DTO conversion with new fields
- `CarBookingDTOS.java` - Added vehicleRegNo, pickupDate, returnDate, pickupLocation to Response DTO
- `CarBookingModel.java` - Already had all required fields

### Frontend:
- `bookings/list.jsp` - Added delete button and JavaScript function
- `bookings/view.jsp` - Added new fields display and delete button

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Bookings not showing
- **Check**: `delete_status = 0` in database
- **Query**: `SELECT * FROM car_bookings WHERE delete_status = 0;`

### Issue: Status update fails
- **Check**: Booking ID exists
- **Check**: Valid status value (PENDING/CONFIRMED/COMPLETED/CANCELLED)
- **Check**: Server logs for exceptions

### Issue: 500 Error on /bookings
- **Check**: Database connection
- **Check**: All required columns exist in `car_bookings` table
- **Query**: `DESCRIBE car_bookings;`
